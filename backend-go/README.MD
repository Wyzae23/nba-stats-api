# 🏀 NBA Stats API (Go + MongoDB)

A lightweight REST API written in Go for querying NBA player information and statistics. It uses the standard library (`net/http`) and connects to a **cloud-hosted MongoDB** instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).

This service is designed as a focused microservice within a future **all-in-one sports data platform**, intended to support multiple leagues and sports with modular, language-agnostic components. The NBA module serves as the foundation for scaling to other sports like NFL, MLB, NHL, and more.

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### ✅ Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.24.1 AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .
RUN go build -o app .

FROM debian:bookworm-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates tzdata && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /app
