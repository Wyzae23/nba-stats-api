# 🏀 NBA Stats Microservice

This repository contains a modular backend system for NBA player statistics. It includes:

- **Go-based REST API** (`/backend-go/`) for querying player data and stats
- **Python scraper** (`/scripts/`) to ingest and update data from the [BallDontLie API](https://www.balldontlie.io) into MongoDB

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is the backend foundation for a future **multi-sport analytics platform**. It is designed to be split into scalable microservices with clean data ingestion and querying layers.
